A basic yet functional project built to practice and strengthen my skills in Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

This application uses HTML, CSS, and EJS for the frontend and templating, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js.

The project supports full CRUD operations along with complete MongoDB database integration, allowing users to add, edit, update, and delete tasks efficiently.
